## Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Uses Azure OpenAI (GPT-4) for natural language understanding
- 🗺️ **Path Finder**: Intelligent shortest path calculation between locations
- 🌐 **Multi-Language Support**: English, Cantonese (粵), and Mandarin (普)
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface inspired by MTR's design
- 🔌 **REST API**: Ready for OutSystems integration
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Azure OpenAI API Key and Endpoint (for GPT-4)

## Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit `.env` and add your Azure OpenAI credentials:
   ```
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_api_key
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com
   AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-12-01-preview
   ```
   
   **Getting Azure OpenAI Credentials:**
   1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
   2. Create or navigate to your Azure OpenAI resource
   3. Go to "Keys and Endpoint" to get your API key and endpoint
   4. Go to "Deployments" to create a GPT-4 deployment (or use existing one)
   5. Use the deployment name in `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

Run both server and client concurrently:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Or run them separately:

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
npm run server
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
npm run client
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000/api

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Then start the server:
```bash
npm run server
```

## API Endpoints

### Chat API

- `POST /api/chat/message` - Send a chat message
  ```json
  {
    "message": "How do I get to the cafeteria?",
    "language": "en",
    "context": {
      "currentLocation": "Main Entrance",
      "availableLocations": "Various offices, spaces, and buildings"
    }
  }
  ```

- `GET /api/chat/health` - Check chat service health

### Path Finder API

- `GET /api/pathfinder/locations` - Get all available locations
- `POST /api/pathfinder/find-path` - Find shortest path between locations
  ```json
  {
    "from": "Main Entrance",
    "to": "Cafeteria"
  }
  ```
- `GET /api/pathfinder/search?q=office` - Search locations

## Configuration

### Location Graph

The path finder uses a graph-based data structure. The system is currently configured for **HSITP Building 8** with data loaded from `server/data/hsitp_locationGraph.json`.

**Current Configuration:**
- **Building**: HSITP Building 8 (Wet Laboratory Facility)
- **Location**: Lok Ma Chau Loop, New Territories, Hong Kong
- **Floors**: 9 floors (Ground Floor to 8th Floor)
- **Locations**: 35 nodes (entrances, labs, offices, facilities)
- **Paths**: 40 edges (connections between locations)

To customize locations, edit `server/data/hsitp_locationGraph.json` or create a new location graph file.

### Visual Representation Format

For floor plans and visual path representation, you can provide:

1. **SVG Floor Plans**: Vector graphics that can be scaled
2. **PNG/JPG Images**: Raster images with coordinate mapping
3. **GeoJSON**: For geographic data
4. **Custom JSON**: With coordinates and waypoints

**Recommended Format**: Provide a JSON file with:
- Floor plan image URL/path
- Coordinate mapping (pixel/real-world coordinates)
- Node positions on the image
- Floor information

Example structure:
```json
{
  "floors": [
    {
      "floor": 1,
      "image": "floor1.png",
      "scale": 1.0,
      "nodes": [
        {
          "id": "entrance",
          "x": 100,
          "y": 200,
          "pixelX": 150,
          "pixelY": 300
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## OutSystems Integration

The API is designed to be easily integrated with OutSystems:

1. **Create REST API Consumer** in OutSystems
2. **Point to endpoints**: `http://your-server:5000/api`
3. **Use the chat endpoint** for AI responses
4. **Use path finder endpoint** for navigation

Example OutSystems integration:
- Add a button/link in your OutSystems UI
- On click, redirect to: `http://your-server:3000?location=Main%20Entrance`
- The chatbot will initialize with the specified location

## Demonstration

To demonstrate without OutSystems:

1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Try queries like:
   - "How do I get to the cafeteria?"
   - "Where is Meeting Room 1?"
   - "Show me the way to Office 201"
   - "How to get to Conference Hall from Main Entrance?"

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Google Maps integration for outdoor navigation
- [ ] Floor plan image overlay for indoor navigation
- [ ] Voice input/output support
- [ ] Real-time location tracking
- [ ] Integration with facility management systems
- [ ] Analytics and usage tracking
- [ ] Multi-building support
- [ ] Accessibility features

## Troubleshooting

### Google API Key Issues
- Ensure your API key is valid and has Gemini API access enabled
- Check that the key is correctly set in `.env` file

### Port Conflicts
- Change `PORT` in `.env` if 5000 is already in use
- Change React port by setting `PORT=3001` in `client/.env`

### CORS Issues
- The server is configured to allow CORS from localhost
- For production, update CORS settings in `server/index.js`
